				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello! I'm Tom, a developer from West Sussex.</p>
				<p>I have always had an interest in coding and web technology, even when I was younger. My dad and I built the first version of my website when I was just 14 and since then I have kept it up to date while I constantly learn new things I can do with it.
				I enjoy the challenge of writing and testing a piece of code, the frustration from problematic code is nothing compared to the satisfaction once it has been fixed!</p>
				<p>I have found ways to dip into coding over the years; briefly at college, developing my website at home, and using VB via Microsoft Excel while in office-based jobs. I have always found myself enjoying it which is why I decided to push myself to learn more and pursue a career from it.</p>
				<p>Away from the desk my main hobby is photography. I enjoy it for similar reasons in that I get to explore creative ways to push myself and learn more, constantly developing over time. Like with coding, the reward from completing a project makes any and all of the setbacks worthwhile!</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Details of my skills and completed projects can be found on the relevant pages, as can my contact information.</p>
