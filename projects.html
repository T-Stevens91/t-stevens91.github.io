					<p>The "Tom Stevens Photography" website is an ongoing live project, as well as the first website I had ever made. There have been many versions and changes over the years but the primary function of the website is to showcase my photography and promote my services. As of 2020 the current version of the website only uses HTML5 and CSS3 technologies while I am learning more.</p>

					<p>While learning JavaScript through Codecademy I developed these games early on. Using JavaScript code, R/P/S allows the user to play Rock, Paper Scissors against a computer oppenent. The number guesser will generate a random number which the player and computer have to try and guess, closest wins.</p>

				<button class="accordion">Credit Card Checker</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<img class="screenshot" src="resources/images/credit.png" alt="code for credit card checker">
					<p>This project showed me some more advanced functionality in Javascript, using objects and arrays for validation in a more practical/realistic setting.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Mixed Messages</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<img class="screenshot" src="resources/images/messages.png" alt="code for mixed messages">
					<p>This project came with only a brief, and was the first where I had to carry out the planning and coding myself without any instructions or help. This was a test of my JavaScript ability.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">Excursion &amp; Tea Cozy</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<img class="screenshot" src="resources/images/excursion.png" alt="spec for excursion"><img class="screenshot" src="resources/images/tea-cozy.png" alt="spec for tea cozy">
					<p>These were two web pages in which I was given a design spec to follow but had to build the HTML/CSS myself.</p>
